# VizTracer

[![build](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)  [![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/viztracer.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/viztracer/)

VizTracer is a deterministic debugging/profiling tool that can trace and visualize python code. The major data VizTracer displays is FEE(function entry/exit), or equivalently, the call stack. 

Unlike traditional flame graph, which is normally generated by sampling profiler, VizTracer can display every function executed and the corresponding entry/exit time from the beginning of the program to the end, which is helpful for programmers to catch sporatic performance issues. 

With VizTracer, the programmer can intuitively understand what their code is doing and how long each function takes.  

You can take a look at the [demo](http://www.minkoder.com/viztracer/result.html) result of an example program running recursive merge and quick sort algorithm.

[trace viewer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult) is used to display the stand alone html data.

VizTracer also supports json output that complies with Chrome trace event format, which can be loaded using [perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/)

## Requirements

VizTracer requires python 3.5+. No other package is needed. For now, VizTracer binary on pip only supports CPython + Linux. However, in theory the source code can build on Windows/MacOS.

## Install

The prefered way to install VizTracer is via pip

```
pip install viztracer
```

You can also download the source code and build it yourself.

## Usage

There are a couple ways to use VizTracer

### Command Line

The easiest way to use VizTracer it through command line. Assume you have a python script to profile and the normal way to run it is:

```
python3 my_script.py
```

You can simply use VizTracer as 

```
python3 -m viztracer my_script.py
```

which will generate a ```result.html``` file in the directory you run this command. Open it in browser and there's your result.

If your script needs arguments like 

```
python3 my_script.py arg1 arg2
```

Just feed it as it is to VizTracer

```
python3 -m viztracer my_script.py arg1 arg2
```

You can also specify the tracer to be used in command line by passing --tracer argument. c tracer is the default value, you can use python tracer instead

```
python3 -m viztracer --tracer c my_script.py
python3 -m viztracer --tracer python my_script.py
```

You can specify the output file using -o or --output_file argument. The default output file is result.html. Two types of files are supported, html and json.
```
python3 -m viztracer -o other_name.html my_script.py
python3 -m viztracer -o other_name.json my_script.py
```

### Inline

Sometimes the command line may not work as you expected, or you do not want to profile the whole script. You can manually start/stop the profiling in your script as well.

First of all, you need to import ```VizTracer``` class from the package, and make an object of it.

```python
from viztracer import VizTracer

tracer = VizTracer()
```

If your code is executable by ```exec``` function, you can simply call ```tracer.run()```

```python
tracer.run("import random;random.randrange(10)")
```

This will as well generate a ```result.html``` file in your current directory. You can pass other file path to the function if you do not like the name ```result.html```

```python
tracer.run("import random; random.randrange(10)", output_file = "better_name.html")
```

When you need a more delicate profiler, you can manually enable/disable the profile using ```start()``` and ```stop()``` function.

```python
tracer.start()
# Something happens here
tracer.stop()
tracer.save() # also takes output_file as an optional argument
```

With this method, you can only record the part that you are interested in

```python
# Some code that I don't care
tracer.start()
# Some code I do care
tracer.stop()
# Some code that I want to skip
tracer.start()
# Important code again
tracer.stop()
tracer.save()
```

**It is higly recommended that ```start()``` and ```stop()``` function should be in the same frame(same level on call stack). Problem might happen if the condition is not met**

### Display Result

By default, VizTracer will generate a stand alone HTML file which you can simply open with Chrome(maybe Firefox?). The front-end uses trace-viewer to show all the data. 

However, you can generate json file as well, which complies to the chrome trace event format. You can load the json file on [perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/), which will replace the deprecated trace viewer in the future. 

At the moment, perfetto did not support locally stand alone HTML file generation, so I'm not able to switch completely to it. The good news is that once you load the perfetto page, you can use it even when you are offline. 

### Choose Tracer

The default tracer for current version is c tracer, which introduce a relatively small overhead(worst case 2-3x) but only works for CPython on Linux. However, if there's other reason that you would prefer a pure-python tracer, you can use python tracer using ```tracer``` argument when you initialize ```VizTracer``` object.

```python
tracer = VizTracer(tracer="python")
```

#### Cleanup of c Tracer

The interface for c trace is almost exactly the same as python tracer, except for the fact that c tracer does not support command line run now. However, to achieve lower overhead, some optimization is applied to c tracer so it will withhold the memory it allocates for future use to reduce the time it calls ```malloc()```. If you want the c trace to free all the memory it allocates while collecting trace, use

```python
tracer.cleanup()
```

## Performance

Overhead is a big consideration when people choose profilers. VizTracer now has a similar overhead as native cProfiler. It works slightly worse in the worst case(Pure FEE) and better in easier case because even though it collects some extra information than cProfiler, the structure is lighter. 

Admittedly, VizTracer is only focusing on FEE now, so cProfiler also gets other information that VizTracer does not acquire.

```

## Limitations

VizTracer uses ```sys.setprofile()``` for its profiler capabilities, so it will conflict with other profiling tools which also use this function. Be aware of it when using VizTracer.
